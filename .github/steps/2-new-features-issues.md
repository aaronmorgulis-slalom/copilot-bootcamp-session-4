# New Feature Ideas from Sogeti Skills Comparison

## 1. Consultant Profile Management
- Allow consultants to create and edit their own profiles (name, contact info, resume upload)
- Consultants can view and manage their own capability registrations

## 2. Per-Consultant Skill Proficiency
- Track each consultant's proficiency level for each registered capability (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Expert)
- Display proficiency in the UI and allow consultants to update it

## 3. Canonical Skills List
- Maintain a master list of skills/capabilities managed by practice leads
- Use this list for autocomplete and to standardize skill naming

## 4. Account Executive (Practice Lead) Role & Dashboard
- Add a special user role for practice leads/account executives
- Dashboard for searching/filtering consultants by skills, name, email, and availability
- Practice leads can manage canonical skills and approve consultant registrations

## 5. Consultant “Beach” (Availability) Status
- Consultants can set their status as "on the beach" (available) or "engaged"
- Practice leads can filter/search by this status

## 6. Resume Management
- Consultants can upload, edit, and download resumes

## 7. Security & Authorization
- Add authentication for all main features
- Implement role-based permissions (consultant vs. practice lead)

## 8. AJAX/UX Enhancements
- Use AJAX for skill add/remove (no page reload)
- Add autocomplete and dropdowns for skill/proficiency selection

## 9. Automated Integration & End-to-End Tests
- Add automated integration and end-to-end tests (e.g., Selenium, MSTest)

Each of these features would be new compared to the current state of the project and would significantly enhance the platform's functionality and user experience.
